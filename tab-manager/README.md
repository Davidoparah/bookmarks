# Tab Manager Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension to manage and organize tabs based on different roles/activities.

## Features

- Create and manage different tab collections (e.g., Job Search, House Hunting, Entertainment, Coding, Studying)
- Save current tabs to a collection
- Open all tabs in a collection with one click
- Delete or modify existing collections
- Smart storage management with cross-device syncing
- Visual indicators for sync status

## Storage Management

The extension implements a smart storage system that:
- Saves small collections (< 8KB) to sync storage for cross-device access
- Saves larger collections to local storage
- Automatically moves collections to sync storage when they become small enough
- Shows clear visual indicators of sync status (ðŸ”„ for synced, ðŸ’» for local)
- Preserves all functionality regardless of storage type

## How It Works

The extension provides a seamless way to manage your browser tabs across different activities or projects:

### Saving Tabs
1. When you have multiple tabs open for a specific activity (e.g., "Job Search"):
   - Click the extension icon
   - Enter a name for your collection (e.g., "Job Applications")
   - Click "Save Current Tabs"
2. The extension will:
   - Capture all tabs in your current window
   - Save their URLs, titles, and favicon information
   - Store them in Chrome's sync storage (limited to 5KB per collection)

### Managing Collections
Each collection is displayed with:
- Collection name and tab count
- List of all saved tabs with favicons and titles
- Controls for individual tabs:
  - Open: Launch a specific tab
  - Delete: Remove a tab from the collection
- Collection-level controls:
  - Open All: Launch all tabs in the collection
  - Delete: Remove the entire collection

### Data Syncing
- Collections automatically sync across all your Chrome browsers
- Uses Chrome's sync storage for seamless cross-device access
- Size limits are enforced (5KB per collection) to ensure sync compatibility
