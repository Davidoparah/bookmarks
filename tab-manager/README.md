# Tab Manager by David Oparah

A powerful Chrome extension designed and developed by David Oparah to help users efficiently manage and organize their browser tabs. This extension combines smart storage management with an intuitive interface to provide a seamless tab organization experience.

## About the Developer

This extension was created by David Oparah, a software developer passionate about creating tools that enhance productivity and improve the browsing experience. The Tab Manager is designed with attention to detail and focuses on providing a smooth, efficient way to organize your digital workspace.

## Features

- Create and manage different tab collections (e.g., Job Search, House Hunting, Entertainment, Coding, Studying)
- Save current tabs to a collection with automatic compression
- Open all tabs in a collection with one click
- Delete or modify existing collections
- Smart storage management with cross-device syncing
- Bulk actions for multiple collections or tabs
- Visual indicators for sync status (ðŸ”„ for synced, ðŸ’» for local)
- Recycle bin for recovering deleted items

## Storage Management

The extension implements a smart storage system that:
- Saves small collections (< 8KB) to sync storage for cross-device access
- Saves larger collections to local storage
- Automatically moves collections to sync storage when they become small enough
- Shows clear visual indicators of sync status (ðŸ”„ for synced, ðŸ’» for local)
- Preserves all functionality regardless of storage type

## How It Works

The extension provides a seamless way to manage your browser tabs across different activities or projects:

### Saving Tabs
1. When you have multiple tabs open for a specific activity (e.g., "Job Search"):
   - Click the extension icon
   - Enter a name for your collection (e.g., "Job Applications")
   - Click "Save Current Tabs"
2. The extension will:
   - Capture all tabs in your current window
   - Save their URLs, titles, and favicon information
   - Store them in Chrome's sync storage (limited to 5KB per collection)

### Managing Collections
Each collection is displayed with:
- Collection name and tab count
- List of all saved tabs with favicons and titles
- Controls for individual tabs:
  - Open: Launch a specific tab
  - Delete: Remove a tab from the collection
- Collection-level controls:
  - Open All: Launch all tabs in the collection
  - Delete: Remove the entire collection

### Data Syncing
- Collections automatically sync across all your Chrome browsers
- Uses Chrome's sync storage for seamless cross-device access
- Size limits are enforced (5KB per collection) to ensure sync compatibility
