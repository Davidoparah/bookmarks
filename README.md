## Storage Management

The extension uses an advanced storage system to maximize sync capabilities while handling larger collections:

### Smart Storage System:
- Automatically compresses data to maximize storage efficiency:
  - Removes common URL prefixes (http://, https://, www.)
  - Truncates long titles while preserving readability
  - Optimizes favicon storage
- Uses Chrome's sync storage (up to 8KB per collection) for cross-device access
- Falls back to local storage (up to 5MB) for larger collections
- Shows clear visual indicators: ðŸ”„ for synced, ðŸ’» for local storage

### Automatic Sync Features:
- Checks every 5 minutes for sync opportunities
- Prioritizes collections based on:
  - Size (smaller collections sync first)
  - Last modified time (recent changes get priority)
- Automatically moves collections to sync storage when space becomes available
- Preserves collection metadata across storage types

### Storage Optimization:
- Intelligent data compression
- Automatic cleanup of unused data
- Size-based storage decisions
- Quota management for both sync and local storage

## Recycle Bin & Recovery

### Recovery Options:
