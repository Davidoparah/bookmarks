## Storage Management

The extension uses a smart storage system to maximize sync capabilities while handling larger collections:

### When Saving Collections:
- If collection is small enough (â‰¤8KB), saves to sync storage for cross-device access
- If too large, automatically saves to local storage
- Shows storage location in the success message (ðŸ”„ for synced, ðŸ’» for local)

### During Loading:
- Loads both synced and local collections
- Shows sync status for each collection with clear visual indicators
- Automatically checks if local collections can be moved to sync storage

### Automatic Sync:
- Periodically checks if local collections can be moved to sync storage
- Automatically moves collections when they meet size requirements (â‰¤8KB)
- Updates UI to reflect any changes in sync status

### Storage Limits:
- Sync storage: Up to 8KB per collection for cross-device syncing
- Local storage: Up to 5MB per collection for larger sets of tabs
- Collections automatically move between storage types as their size changes

## Recycle Bin & Recovery

The extension includes a recycle bin feature to help recover accidentally deleted items:

### Deleted Items Recovery:
